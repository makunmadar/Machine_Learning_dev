# Machine leanring development

This repo contains scripts to import GALFORM data, train and evaluate a machine learning emulator using the GALFORM data, and finally calibrate a new GALFORM model on observations using the emulator and Bayesian statistical methods. 

## Required Python Packages 

As well as the usual scientific packages (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib etc...) it a requirement to have the Tensorflow and Keras packages installed. 
For example if using pip: 

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
This should also install Keras within tensorflow.
